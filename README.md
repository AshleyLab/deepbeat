DeepBeat: Multi-task deep learning for cardiac rhythm detection in wearable devices
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DeepBeat is a deep learning model for
  1) classification of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and 
  2) signal quality estimation  

Dataset
-------
We share a deidentified train, validate and test partition that were used for training DeepBeat. These deidentified signal are shared with a non-commerical data use agreement and can be found at synapase, ID:syn21985690.


Examples
-------
We have included juypter notebooks and trained models for reproduciblility.
